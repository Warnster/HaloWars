# Halo Waypoint Copy

This project is a replacement for the deprecated [halowaypoint.com](https://halowaypoint.com)

It takes the styles, layout and images from the halowaypoint before 01/11/21 and binds it with the [halo api](https://developer.haloapi.com/) to simulate the original website.

## Production

You can find this project running at [halowarpoint.com](https://halowarpoint.com) 

It still uses dev access keys, so development has been made with managing request amounts in mind. This means
some sections of the application can't be completed such as: leaderboard stats

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run-script start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run-script test`

There are currently no tests which is how all code should be :)

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run-script build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
